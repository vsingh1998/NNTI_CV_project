In this project, we address the computer vision task of image classification using semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques. In the first and second tasks, we train a WideResNet using the two popular SSL algorithms, namely Pseudo-Labeling and Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. For the third task, we try to improve upon the existing SSL technique Pseudo-Labeling by adding a Siamese Network based on a triplet loss on top of it for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.
